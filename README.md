# 01 Horiseon Refactoring

## Outcomes



**Alt Text Additions** Alternative text has been added to images, to allow for better search engine optimization. Alt text also ensures that visually impaired users are able to interact with media as presented, allowing all users to utilize the webportal with efficacy.

**Semantic HTML Additions**  Semantic HTML elements have been added, allowing other programmers to more easily distinguish meaningful sections. This addition also assists in search engine optimization, as search engines are more easily able to 'read' the contents of the webpage.  

**Title Addition** Addition of a meaningful title, allowing the webportal to have a more holistic and internally consistent appearance.

**Heading Attributes Ordered** Heading attributes are used in the appropriate manner, allowing other programmers to make meaningful distincions between h1-h3 HTML elements.
